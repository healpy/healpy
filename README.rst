====================================
Healpy, a python wrapper for healpix
====================================

Description
-----------

Healpy provides a python package to manipulate healpix maps. It is
based on the standard numeric and visualisation tools for Python,
Numpy and matplotlib.

To find find more information about Healpix, please visit its home
page at http://healpix.jpl.nasa.gov/.

The documentation can be found at http://healpy.readthedocs.org, 
tutorial at http://healpy.readthedocs.org/en/latest/tutorial.html.

Characteristics
---------------

* pixelisation manipulation (ang2pix, pix2ang, *etc.*)

* spherical harmonic transforms (map2alm, alm2map, synfast, anafast,
  *etc.* both for temperature and polarisation)

* plotting capabilities (mollweide and gnomonic projection)

* reading and writing of Healpix FITS maps and alm

Requirements
------------

* `Python <http://www.python.org>`_, tested with 2.4, 2.5, 2.6 and
  2.7; however see `bug <http://code.google.com/p/healpy/issues/detail?id=19>`_ 
  for Python 2.4.

* `Numpy <http://numpy.scipy.org/>`_ (tested with version >=1.0.1)

* `Matplotlib <http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/>`_ (tested with
  version >= 0.91.2 up to 1.0.1, please use latest version)

  - **Note:** Matplotlib 0.98.3 has a bug preventing mollview to work.
    Either correct the bug as indicated `there <http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_id=E1Kjmcj-0001UI-Ey%40dn4whf1.ch3.sourceforge.com>`_
    or update to more recent version (>= 0.98.4).

* Python development package is required for some distribution (e.g.,
  python-dev package for Ubuntu)

* `PyFITS <http://www.stsci.edu/resources/software_hardware/pyfits>`_

  - **Note:** For healpix map Nside=8192, there is a bug in Numpy
    preventing pyfits to work. You should upgrade to latest pyfits
    version (>= 2.1) which provide a workaround.

The Healpix C++ library (from HEALPix 2.11 or HEALPix 2.20 for healpy >=
0.10) is included in the healpy package, so you don't need to get it
separately.

Acknowledgements
----------------

Note that, as stated `here
<http://healpix.jpl.nasa.gov/healpixSoftwareGetHealpix.shtml>`_
publications based on work using the HEALPix software package should
include both of the following:

1. an acknowledgment statement: "Some of the results in this paper
   have been derived using the HEALPix (Górski et al., 2005)
   package". The complete reference is:

      Górski, K.M., E. Hivon, A.J. Banday, B.D. Wandelt, F.K. Hansen,
      M. Reinecke, and M. Bartelmann, HEALPix: A Framework for
      High-resolution Discretization and Fast Analysis of Data
      Distributed on the Sphere, Ap.J., 622, 759-771, 2005.

2. at the first use of the HEALPix acronym, a footnote placed in the
   main body of the paper referring to the HEALPix web site,
   currently http://healpix.jpl.nasa.gov

As healpy is based on HEALPix Software (the C++ library), the same
condition applies to it.

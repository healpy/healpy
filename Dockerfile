# To use this image, first build the dockerfile by switching
# to the directory in which it is located and then running
# >> docker build -t hp .
# This builds the image, and
# >> docker images
# will show you the healpy (hp) image, as well as the
# underlying python-3.6-slim image.
#
# After that, run the image with
# >> docker run -d -t --name healpy -v "$(pwd)":/home/healpy hp:latest
# This will run the image (i.e. create a container, which is an instance of 
# that image) and mount the current directory, so that you can directly modify
# the content of the container, without having to access it.
# 
# You can then use
# >> docker exec -it healpy /bin/bash
# to start a bash session in the container, and interact with the healpy package.
# This is very helpful to install the package, run tests, etc., while the files can be edited
# and added to source control outside of the container due to the mount.
